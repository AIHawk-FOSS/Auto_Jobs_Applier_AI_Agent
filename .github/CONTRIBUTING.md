# Issues Reporting Guidelines

Welcome to the LinkedIn Auto Jobs Applier with AI issues page! To keep things organized and ensure issues are resolved quickly, please follow the guidelines below when submitting a bug report, feature request, or any other issue.

## Before You Submit an Issue

### 1. Search Existing Issues

Please search through the existing open issues and closed issues to ensure your issue hasn’t already been reported. This helps avoid duplicates and allows us to focus on unresolved problems.

### 2. Check Documentation

Review the README and any available documentation to see if your issue is covered.

### 3. Provide Detailed Information

If you are reporting a bug, make sure you include enough details to reproduce the issue. The more information you provide, the faster we can diagnose and fix the problem.

## Issue Types

### 1. Bug Reports

Please include the following information:

- **Description:** A clear and concise description of the problem.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Provide detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
- **Expected Behavior:** What should have happened.
- **Actual Behavior:** What actually happened.
- **Environment Details:** Include your OS, browser version (if applicable), and any other relevant environment details.

### 2. Feature Requests

For new features or improvements:

- Clearly describe the feature you would like to see.
- Explain the problem this feature would solve or the benefit it would bring.
- If possible, provide examples or references to similar features in other tools or platforms.

### 3. Questions/Discussions

- If you’re unsure whether something is a bug or if you’re seeking clarification on functionality, you can ask a question. Please make sure to label your issue as a question.

- **question:** Additional information or clarification is needed.
- **wontfix:** The issue will not be fixed or addressed.
- We aim to respond to issues as early as possible. Please be patient, as maintainers may have limited availability.

If you’re able to contribute a fix for an issue:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your fix.
2. Reference the issue number in your branch and pull request.
3. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of the changes and how they resolve the issue.
