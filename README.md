### 2. config.yaml


### PLUS. data_folder_example

The `data_folder_example` folder contains a working example of how the files necessary for the bot's operation should be structured and filled out. This folder serves as a practical reference to help you correctly set up your work environment for the LinkedIn job search bot.

#### Contents

Inside this folder, you'll find example versions of the key files:

- `secrets.yaml`

- `plain_text_resume.yaml`

These files are already populated with fictitious but realistic data. They show you the correct format and type of information to enter in each file.

#### Usage

Using this folder as a guide can be particularly helpful for:

1. Understanding the correct structure of each configuration file
2. Seeing examples of valid data for each field
3. Having a reference point while filling out your personal files

- **Dynamic Resume Generation:**
  If you don't use the `--resume` option, the bot will automatically generate a unique resume for each application. This feature uses the information from your `plain_text_resume.yaml` file and tailors it to each specific job application, potentially increasing your chances of success by customizing your resume for each position.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
- **Using a Specific Resume:**
  If you want to use a specific PDF resume for all applications, place your resume PDF in the `data_folder` directory and run the bot with the `--resume` option:
  ```bash
  python main.py --resume /path/to/your/resume.pdf
  ```
